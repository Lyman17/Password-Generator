## Credits & Citations

This project took a significant portion of time for me to understand. Throughout the coursework, each lesson is briefly touched upon & the use of all of it being combined was a lot to download. Many conversations were had with ChatGPT, I went back & forth trying to learn & understand this entire code. 

In the end, that ultimately culminated to the finalization of the code to be done using ChatGPT

I also spent 1 hours time with my tutor Alex Gonzalez at the UofU in order to fully understand everything going on within this code.

Structure of Read ME was researched & formatted by using the following link:
